h2. What

	RubyPython is a C bridge between Ruby and Python with a Ruby interface. It's aim is to make the power of the Python's great standard library available to Ruby programmers from within Ruby.
	
h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install rubypython</pre>

Don't worry if you got some ugly output from RDOC and RI.

h2. The Basics

Check out the RDOC pages at "http://rubypython.rubyforge.org/rdoc":http://rubypython.rubyforge.org/rdoc

I have only tested this on Mac OS 10.5 with Python 2.5. If anyone has issues with another setup let me know and I'll do what I can.
