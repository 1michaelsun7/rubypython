h2. Is it in active development?

       The short answer: Sort of. I started rubypython a couple of years
       ago in connection with some work I was doing as part of a
       summer research job. I actively worked on it a for a period of
       a few months from that time onward. Since then I have moved on
       to other things more closely related to my chosen field, although I do
       still come back now and again to tinker with the project.
       
       Nonetheless, I am always happy to help debug the code if a
       problem should arise. So don't hesitate to contact me if you
       have trouble.

h2. What

	RubyPython is a C bridge between Ruby and Python with a Ruby interface. It's aim is to make the power of the Python's great standard library available to Ruby programmers from within Ruby.
	
	

h3. Installing

    To install execute the following:

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install rubypython</pre>

Don't worry if you got some ugly output from RDOC and RI.

h2. The Basics

Check out the RDOC pages at "http://rubypython.rubyforge.org/rdoc":http://rubypython.rubyforge.org/rdoc

I have tested the system on Mac OS 10.5 and Ubuntu Jaunty 9.04. If anyone has issues with another setup let me know and I'll do what I can.
